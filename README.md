# -r-todayilearned-Post-Checker
This is a python script to check for new TIL posts every 30 seconds and display the latest post (if any new one has been posted)

This script checks for new posts by their title and displays it.
It also formats the title by removing strings such as 'TIL about', 'TIL that', etc.
